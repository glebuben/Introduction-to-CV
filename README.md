# 🧠 Introduction to Computer Vision – Labs

This repository contains lab work completed as part of the **Introduction to Computer Vision** course. The focus of this course is on understanding core concepts in computer vision and building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch** using Python and NumPy.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/\
├── labs/ # Jupyter notebooks for each lab session\
└── README.md # Course overview and instructions


## 🔍 Description

All content is located in the `labs/` directory and consists of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) that cover core topics in image processing and deep learning for vision tasks.

A major focus of the course is the **step-by-step construction of a CNN from scratch** — including forward and backward passes, loss functions, and training loops — without using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python 3
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:**  
  - NumPy (core numerical operations)  
  - Matplotlib (visualization)  

> **Note:** No external deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) were used in the CNN implementation — everything was built manually for educational purposes. Nevertheless, PyTorch was used for verification process

## 🧪 Topics Covered

Throughout the lab sessions, the following computer vision and deep learning topics were explored:

- Image representation and processing
- Filters and edge detection
- Convolutions and pooling
- CNN architecture and layers
- Forward and backward propagation
- Loss functions and optimization
- Training and evaluation of a basic CNN
- Visualization of learned filters and feature maps

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision.git
   cd Introduction-to-Computer-Vision
